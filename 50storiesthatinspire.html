                                initially told he would never walk again. My daughter came with me several times to

                                Afghanistan for a year. He said, “I usually bring home a bouquet of flowers for my wife

                                delivery of a bouquet of flowers every day Friday until he returned. I gave a 50%

                                matter of life and death. He sat still for a moment, and then he said goodbye to his
                                parents. I do not think anything about it until after we took his blood and he asked,

                                <b>50.</b> Today, when I saw my grandmother and 75-year-old kakkeku silly joke with each other
                                and laughing in the kitchen, I feel like I got a glimpse of what true love. I hope to
                                feel it someday.
                                <br><br>
                                May the love story above can inspire your actions to people you care about.
