                            <p>
                                The most important discovery of all time since ages is that of fire. Without fire,
                                nothing
                                can work. If we consider any small thing, let it be cooking to any large thing, let it
                                be a
                                steam engine, nothing can work without the help of fire. And the most amusing fact is
                                that
                                the discovery of fire was actually an accident. Heat was produced due to friction, when
                                two
                                stones got rubbed against each other. This heat gave rise to fire in the dry hay, and
                                marked one of the most crucial discoveries ever made by human beings. Luckily, this
                                discovery took place in the early centuries by the cave men.

                                Another invention made by the cave men, that altered the face of Earth. This invention

                                surely not a mistake, but came into life through observation and use of mind.
                                Transporting
                                goods from one place to another just by pushing or pulling them seemed to be tiring and
                                a
                                difficult task to do, so the cave men gave it some thought, observed the structure of
                                trees, and tried making such circular things on which, they could balance a plate and
                                could keep their goods on them for the purpose of transportation. The job became much
                                easy
                                and less cumbersome.

                            <p>
                                Salute to Sir Thomas Alva Edison, who thought of flying a kite in the stormy weather,
                                with
                                a metallic key attached to one end of the thread, which he held in his hand. As soon as
                                the electric current from the clouds stroked the kite, the current started flowing and
                                as
                                he touched the key, he felt an electric current passing through his body, as his feet
                                touched the ground, giving the effect of Earthing. This marked the beginning of
                                discovery
                                of electricity, which enabled other discoveries like those of light bulbs, air
                                conditioners etc. Now, a time has come, when we can’t even survive for a couple of hours
                                without electricity.

                            </h2>
                            <p>
                                So, the clothes you wear, I hope they are a necessity for you! But have you ever
                                wondered, from where did these clothes came? Does mother nature provide readymade
                                clothes? I have never seen clothes growing on trees or insects wearing them. Well, this
                                all is obtained from the raw materials of cotton or silk. Cotton grows on plants and are
                                separated for further processing, which includes the process of weaving etc. but the
                                first process that it goes through is separation of cotton seeds from the fluffy cotton.
                                Hand Separation used to take a large amount of time, causing less productivity, so
                                Cotton Gin machines used to perform same operations in a very less amount of time, hence
                                acting as a huge invention.

                            <p>
                                If we go in the Pyramids of Egypt or any such historical monument, we will find
                                inscriptions on the walls, showing the people of that time performing various chores.
                                That
                                was a way of saving the current data so that the future people could learn, how the past
                                was. This also give us an information that the task of writing and conveying messages
                                through drawings was developed a long time before the discovery of pen and paper. It can
                                easily be inferred from these early drawings that it took a large amount of effort to
                                draw
                                these things, as they didn’t have many developed instruments to perform those tasks. So,
                                with the discovery of paper and pen, this task became much easier. The use if paper and
                                pen became extremely common in all fields of work, and is the best way of communication
                                and storing data.

                                After the blueprints were made, James Watt put in much more efforts to mark an important
                                invention, which changed the way we live. The invention was that of Steam Engine. Steam
                                is
                                a powerful fuel for locomotive. This idea first came in the mind of James Watt, who
                                started
                                putting in most of his time thinking about getting a practical use of Steam into daily
                                life, when finally he ended up in the discovery of Steam Engine, which remained a method
                                of
                                inexpensive transportation for hundreds of years.

                                A new discovery is said to be important, only if it is more useful than the discovery of
                                its previous kind. The idea of Steam Engine saw a downfall after the discovery of
                                Internal
                                and External Combustion Engines, but if we see properly, they all work on the procedures
                                of
                                Steam Engine only. So the discovery of Steam Engine was a base for the discovery of much
                                more widely used mode of transportation called Automobiles. Now, wherever you see, you
                                will
                                find hundreds of automobiles crossing the streets to reach their destinations.

                                Thanks to Wright Brothers, who gave the idea of flight. Although much before they gave
                                their design, Leonardo da Vinci, the great artist, whose masterpiece is said to be “Mona
                                Lisa” gave a working design of an airplane, but that design couldn’t be developed, so he
                                didn’t come in much limelight because of his airplane design. The Wright Brothers were
                                the
                                first ever to make a working model of an airplane, which actually marked a flight, and
                                began an era of a quick mode of transportation.
