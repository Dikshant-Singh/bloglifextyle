                                continues to inspire now as well. The beautifully rising sun when fills the canvas of

                            <p>
                                Nature keeps teaching us a variety of lessons through its various forms. Everyone can
                                look
                                upon to one form or the other and discover its various teachings. Every time a full moon
                                graces the sky with its presence again, we understand the importance of all our loved
                                ones
                                who at some point or the other might have gone away just to come back like the moon
                                comes.
                                The decreasing moon often might feel depressing yet it teaches us to accept the fate and
                                come back anew. A night sky without stars looks curtailed while without a moon is
                                unfinished. But when both of them accompany each other, the view certainly says too many
                                things. You realize that however important you might be, you need someone or the other
                                to
                                complete you.

                                When we talk about nature,one cannot forget the gushing rivers. Rivers constantly keep
                                heading towards the sea for its awaited unison. Well aware of the fact that it has a
                                protracted way ahead and the path is intricate, it continues to flow. Human nature has
                                always been evident of choosing the path which has lesser obstacles and has lesser
                                efforts. If we are to take a few lessons from playful rivers then always, the best
                                lesson
                                would be face every difficulty with equal energy and flow with whatever the outcome is
                                towards the main goal of life.

                                Nature and its various wonders have been exploited and destructed to a large scale
                                nowadays. The number of calamities be it, natural or man-made have elevated over a
                                period
                                of time. The natural assets are either being overused or not taken care of. If the same
                                situation was faced by humans or any other living being, they would have been aggressive
                                and rebelled against it. But nature in return is being generous and patient with all the
                                harm that is being caused to it. Here also it doesn’t fail to teach us that one can be
                                as
                                selfish and get what he wants but the real skill is to be selfless and get happy in
                                getting what one really needs. Nature like humans is not blessed with intellectual still
                                humans fail to understand what is their requirement and what is it that they take in for
                                granted. Nature teaches us to recognize this difference and act accordingly towards
                                progress.

                            </h1>
                            <p>
                                I often wonder what clock god must be using to keep track of an assortment of seasons
                                that he bestows us with. The sunny summer brings us warmth while the wet monsoons brings
                                us the sweet fragrance ,the winter gets us cosy chills while the spring gets us jolly
                                blossoms and the autumn gets us aridity. Each season has its own message for us. The
                                important thing is how we decipher these messages. Thus, all these seasons teach us to
                                understand the silence and do the needful. They say actions explain a lot more than
                                words
                                do, but not all actions are blessed with voice. Understanding the taciturn proves your
                                intelligence. And this skill we can learn from all the seasons.

                                There is a peak time when our daily schedule seems to be monotonous and we feel the
                                utmost necessity of a break. Somewhere where our mind is at peace, where you and your
                                thoughts alone is what matters and horizon is the limit. One such incredible corner that
                                nature provides is beaches and islands. The cities masked with pollution and veiled by
                                chaos tend to make you unaware of your own identity, your health and mental peace. The
                                mesmerizing view all over, the tickling sand beyond, endlessly stretched aqua marine and
                                the clear skies above seem be special present from god with a virtual card telling you
                                to
                                open when you want to know how important peace is in this life cut that is into pieces.
                                The synchronization between sun and water of splashing colours over each other all day
                                long makes you take in the importance of that one person who you would like yourself to
                                sync in with forever. That faith in that almighty above dwells in your heart at such
                                moments.

                                Strong determination and grit is often the necessity of dreaming and fulfilling those
                                dreams. Failure strikes hard always and we need a strong mindset to regain ourselves to
                                overpower its effects. At such times we can look forward to learn from one small
                                creature
                                – the butterfly. Butterfly is the most fragile mortal existing. It has a long journey of
                                struggles which starts from it coming out of cocoon till turning out into beautiful life
                                filling the world with colours. At every stage it falls in the face of ground, yet every
                                time it rises and tries to shine bright. It teaches us that “within you is the power to
                                rise above any situation or struggle, and transform into the Brightest, Strongest
                                version
                                of you EVER!”.

                            </h1>
                            <p>
                                They say god could not be everywhere so he made small little packets of his essence and
                                gifted it to us into various forms of nature. One of the best packets he gave us
                                contained his most special element of nature that is ‘love’. Lots has been said and felt
                                about love stories in novels, but we failed to observe the love that nature has for
                                everybody. Human race has here and again loved conditionally where caste, religion,
                                color, money and gender had all been the conditions. Whereas when it comes to nature, it
                                has loved everyone and everything. A tree doesn’t discriminates while giving fruits,
                                rainfall is received by rich as well as poor while the sky shelters Hindus, Muslims,
                                Christians and all other religions then why is it that humans have so many differences?
                                Thus the best teaching that we can inculcate in us from nature is equality and loving
                                unconditionally
                                <br><br><br>
                                -
                                Finally one can say that nature has lots in store for us, it depends how we take those
                                teachings and implement it.
